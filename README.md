# Python Recursion Error: Infinite Recursion

This repository demonstrates a common error in recursive functions in Python: infinite recursion due to a missing or incomplete base case. The `factorial_bug.py` file contains a factorial function that causes a `RecursionError` when given a negative input. The `factorial_solution.py` file provides a corrected version.
